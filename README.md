# WTA-Predictions
- This project will allow a user to choose two tennis players from the Womenâ€™s Tennis Association (WTA) database at https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_wta to determine which player would win a match. The user interface will use be website using HTML, JavaScript and CSS.  The backend will use python and Jupiter Notebook.  Machine learning will be used to predict the outcomes. The features we will need to be determined by the relevance of the data to the outcome of a match. The dates of data used will also need to be considered.  Will we use all players since data has been gathered so for example a user could pair Billie Jean King against Serena Williams even though they never played against each others

- Questions they hope to answer with the data

# Machine Learning Model 
We will use Machine Learning for the prediction of professional tennis matches. First, we will use suprevised machine learning, an approach that uses historical player performance accross a wide variety of statistics to predict match outcomes. Subsequently, we can further optimeze and develop the machine learning models Team members will be expected to present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
- Takes in data from the provisional database
- Outputs label for input data

# Database Integration
Team members will be expected to present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:

- Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
- Draft machine learning model is connected to the provisional database

# Description of the communication protocols
We will communicate during class sessions, via Zoom for additional video meetings and using the capstone-project_group-three channel.
